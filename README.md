### üåé Streamlined Multispectral & SAR Analysis for Google Earth Engine Python API

### [See documentation here](https://radgeetoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**RadGEEToolbox** is an open-source Python package that simplifies the processing and analysis of satellite imagery using the Google Earth Engine Python API. It provides ready-to-use tools for filtering, masking, mosaicking, spectral index calculations, and extracting statistics from multispectral (Landsat, Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) datasets.

Designed for both new and advanced users of Google Earth Engine, RadGEEToolbox minimizes repetitive scripting, accelerates common remote sensing workflows, and aims to maximize efficiency within the constraints of the Google Earth Engine API. Whether you‚Äôre building a time series of vegetation indices or extracting surface properties along transects, this package helps get results faster.

## Key Features

- Modular tools for processing **Landsat, Sentinel-1 SAR, and Sentinel-2** imagery
- Efficient filtering, masking, and mosaicking of Earth Engine image collections
- Built-in support for computing **spectral indices** (NDWI, NDVI, LST, turbidity, chlorophyll, etc.)
- SAR utilities for **multilooking**, **speckle filtering**, and **backscatter conversion**
- Automated extraction of **transect and zonal statistics** across image collections
- Easy conversion between RadGEEToolbox and standard Earth Engine objects
- Server-side‚Äìfriendly workflows and caching for faster, scalable processing

üîç For a full breakdown of available tools, see the [RadGEEToolbox documentation ¬ª](https://radgeetoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Usage Example

Below is an example use case using the `LandsatCollection` module to create an NDWI image collection, create water classification maps, and create a time series of water area.

### 1. Create a Filtered Landsat Image Collection

```python
# 1. Import necessary packages and modules
import ee
from RadGEEToolbox import LandsatCollection

# 2. Authenticate & Initialize GEE API
ee.Authenticate()
ee.Initialize()

# 3. Define study area boundary - in this case Lake Powell, Utah
study_area = ee.Geometry.Polygon(
        [[[-111.35875055487008, 37.19999663127137],
          [-111.35875055487008, 37.00119876939416],
          [-111.12048456365915, 37.00119876939416],
          [-111.12048456365915, 37.19999663127137]]])

# 3. Create a Landsat image collection for a given time range and study area
# includes filtering imagery based on areal percentage of cloud cover
# WRS-2 tile(s) can also be used for filtering instead of an ROI geometry
collection = LandsatCollection(
    start_date='2020-01-01', #date formats of 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    end_date='2025-01-01',
    cloud_percentage_threshold=10, #filtering to <10% cloud coverage
    boundary=study_area #ee.Geometry() of your study area
    )

# 4. Check collection by printing the dates of all images in the collection
dates = collection.dates 
print(dates)
```
### 2. Apply a Cloud Mask and Compute NDWI
```python
# 1. Mask clouds 
cloud_masked_collection = collection.masked_clouds_collection
# 2. Create a collection of singleband NDWI images with band names of 'ndwi'
cloud_masked_NDWI_collection = cloud_masked_collection.ndwi
# BONUS - 3. Create water classification maps using a user-set binary NDWI threshold
water_classification_maps = cloud_masked_collection.ndwi_collection(
      threshold=0
      )
```
![Visualization of true color and classified water (in blue) from one of the dates in the collection](image-3.png)

### 3. Calculate Water Area Time Series
```python
calculate_water_area = cloud_masked_NDWI_collection.PixelAreaSumCollection(
      band_name='ndwi', #specify band to use from collection
      geometry=study_area), #ee.Geometry() of your study area
      threshold=0, #binary classification threshold for unclassified rasters,
      scale=90 #pixel size for zonal statistics
      )
print('List of square meters of water in images:', 
      calculate_water_area.aggregate_array('ndwi').getInfo())
```
