RadGEEToolbox documentation
===========================
**RadGEEToolbox** is an open-source Python package that simplifies the processing and analysis of satellite imagery using the Google Earth Engine Python API. It provides ready-to-use tools for filtering, masking, mosaicking, spectral index calculations, and extracting statistics from multispectral (Landsat, Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) datasets.

Designed for both new and advanced users of Google Earth Engine, RadGEEToolbox minimizes repetitive scripting, accelerates common remote sensing workflows, and aims to maximize efficiency within the constraints of the Google Earth Engine API. Whether you are building a time series of vegetation indices or extracting surface properties along transects, this package helps get results faster.
