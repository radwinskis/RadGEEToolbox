Why use RadGEEToolbox?
======================

If you are a new or expert user of GEE and/or Landsat or Sentinel imagery, these tools greatly help reduce the amount of code needed for satellite image filtering, processing, analysis, and visualization. 

Although similar toolset packages exist, RadGEEToolbox offers differing functionality and additional functionality not found in other existing toolsets (Table 1). 

The most commonly used remote sensing data management and image processing workflows are built-in to RadGEEToolbox, so you can more easily get to your goal: an informative dataset, stored in a friendly format. 

RadGEEToolbox is about **quality-of-life** and **comprehensive features** for everyday Google Earth Engine users. Each function is very useful for common tasks not otherwise readily achievable using the GEE API alone.

Statement of Need
=================

Working in `Google Earth Engine` often involves steep learning curves and complex scripting. `RadGEEToolbox` simplifies this by automating common multispectral and SAR workflows while remaining fully compatible with native GEE workflows. It's designed for students, researchers, and analysts working with Landsat and Sentinel imagery, enabling efficient time series analysis, surface property extraction, and visualization of environmental indicators. Ultimately, RadGEEToolbox makes it easier to perform multi-temporal analyses, extract surface properties or time series, generate land cover statistics, and visualize key environmental indicators by handling much of the complexity inherent in Google Earth Engine API interactions and image processing tasks.

While several Python packages extend Google Earth Engine capabilities, including geemap for interactive mapping, eemont for simplified spectral index calculations, and geetools for broad utility functions, RadGEEToolbox takes a different approach. Rather than providing a general-purpose set of method extensions to Earth Engine objects, RadGEEToolbox offers a modular, workflow-oriented API centered around user-defined collection classes in addition to a set of Earth Engine method extensions. These objects bundle common operations, such as filtering, cloud masking, mosaicking, spectral index calculation, and zonal statistics into streamlined, reusable workflows with minimal boilerplate code. This design emphasizes rapid implementation of end-to-end pipelines for scientific studies, particularly for hydrology, geomorphology, forestry, and time series landscape analysis. In this way, RadGEEToolbox complements existing packages while providing a focused solution for efficient, reproducible remote sensing workflows.
